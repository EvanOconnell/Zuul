 *  
 *  NEW CHANGES - 1/17/13 Evan O'Connell:
 *  Added workshop, basement, hallway and vault. Workshop seems like just 
 *  another room, until you remember that there's always been that basement
 *  used for storage there. When you look in the basement, you see a hallway
 *  you've never seen before. The dark hallway leads to the vault full of
 *  old pieces of technology and relics of the past the school has saved.
 *
